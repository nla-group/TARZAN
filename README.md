# TARZAN
This repository contains a python implementation of TARZAN, a fast anomaly detection
algorithm introduced in [1]. The current implementation uses either Brute Force or
McCreight method [4] to construct the suffix tree.

The authors of [3] demonstrate how SAX can be combined with TARZAN for anomaly detection.
The TARZAN function allows a SAX, 1d-SAX or ABBA constructor [2].

## Prerequisites
Install python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing
Run the unit tests by the following command:
```
python test_TARZAN.py -v
```

## TODO
* Improve documentation.
* Implement Ukkonen method [5].
* Store z-score in suffix tree to prevent repetitive computation. Currently edges
  contain substrings so not every substring has a node. This prevents breadth
  search as recommended in [1].
