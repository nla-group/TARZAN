# TARZAN
This repository contains a Python implementation of TARZAN, a fast anomaly detection
algorithm introduced in [1]. The current implementation uses either a brute force or
the McCreight method [4] for constructing the suffix tree.

The authors of [3] demonstrate how SAX can be combined with TARZAN for anomaly detection.
The TARZAN function allows a SAX, 1d-SAX, or ABBA constructor [2].

## Prerequisites
Install python packages:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Testing
Run the unit tests by the following command:
```
python test_TARZAN.py -v
```

## TODO
* Current implementation not linear! Store z-score in suffix tree to prevent repetitive
  computation. Currently edges contain substrings so not every substring has a node.
  This prevents breadth search as recommended in [1].
* Improve documentation.
* Implement Ukkonen method [5].
